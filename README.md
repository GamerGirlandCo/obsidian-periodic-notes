# Periodic Notes

Create and manage all of your time-based notes within Obsidian.

This plugin allows you to:
- Create notes for any periodic of time (daily, weekly, monthly, etc)
- Jump to any time-based notes using natural language (requires NL Dates plugin)
- Easily orient yourself in a sea of `202204101611 Zettelkasten Prefixed notes`

## Features

### Calendar sets

A **calendar set** describes a collection of periodic notes. Now you no longer need to have a single Daily Note, instead you can have one for each pillar of your life. Have a clean break between Personal and Work. Track a project. Track client work. Organize your school work. Calendar sets offer _flexibility_ for you to live more strict.

### Date switcher



Two of the biggest pain points in workflows involving Periodic notes and Zettelkasten-ish notes are **note recall** and **navigation**. The date switcher attempts to solve both of these issues. Use natural language to quickly find periodic notes and other date-related notes. Looking for a meeting note from last week? Just search: `last week ‚á• meeting`. It's my proudest feature of this release and I really hope you love it.

### Timeline **complication**

The date switcher will have you zipping around from note to note so fast you might start getting a bit lost. But don't fret! There is now a timeline "complication" on the top-right of your periodic notes that shows you in natural language exactly where you are.

## FAQ

### How do I use a variable in the folder path?

If you want new daily notes to show up in the folder `Journal/2021/` for example, you can include the folder in the "Format" field. For example:

### Why the weekly note title is wrong with the week number?

Depending on your locale and operating system you are using, you may have been adopting either ISO week (first week of the year is started on the first Thursday) or Week of Year (first week of the year is started on the first day). Obsidian Periodic Notes uses Week of Year by default (ww), but you can change to ISO week by using (WW) instead. For more details, please refer to [MomentJS documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).
